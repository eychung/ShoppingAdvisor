Only the base 24 products (assigned manually to the leaf nodes of the shopping advisor tree are considered for training using RankSVM)

Nodes are numbered starting from index 0, moving down L to R from the root along each level.

Training node 0 (ie the root node, which is null in terms of user attributes) is impossible since the labels +1 for all 24 base products (no negative data available)
